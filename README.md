What is Acid?
=======
Acid is a utility library for building CWAs (Conscious Web Apps). CWAs build themselves based on realtime application demands. Think of a bridge formed in front of you while walking across. Instead of the entire step formed little bits of it come when needed. Acid embraces a modular philosophy that results in a complete separation of concerns.

_CWA's have advantages over modern SPAs_
 - Scalability for large apps
 - Real-time
 - Fine grained self-construction
 - Less code
 - Faster development
 - Streaming apps
