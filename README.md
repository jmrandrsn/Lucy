What is Acid?
=======
Acid is a utility library for building CWAs (Conscious Web Apps). CWAs build themselves based on realtime application demands. Acid embraces a modular philosophy that results in a complete separation of concerns. Lucy has all of Acid's functions except browser based methods. Lucy is designed for worker and node use.
